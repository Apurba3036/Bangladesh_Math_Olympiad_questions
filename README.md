# About BANGLADESH MATH OLYMPIAD

 BMO started its journey in April 2001. Each year we organize months-long, country wide festivals around mathematics. It is open for school & college going students (upto class XII) of the country. The usual timing of the festivals is around December - February. With the dedicated effort of the members of the Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad Committee (BdMOC), the daily newspaper "Prothom-Alo" and the "Dutch Bangla Bank Limited" (DBBL) has already achieved some of its primary goals. This includes sending a team to the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), with a gold medal. Bangladeshi students have been participating in the In IMO since 2005.
